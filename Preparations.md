# Preparations for IELTS

## Speaking Part

### Part One

#### 1. Hometwon

###### 1.Where's your hometown?

Well, that's Jinan, just right here, the captical city of Shandong Province, which located in the east part of China. Jinan is quite a beautiful place, and it is surrounded by mountains, despite the north side, there's a huge lake there, which is called Daming Lake. And there's plenty of springs not far from the lake, like the Baotu Spring. Anyway, that's my hometown, a beautiful place.

###### 2. Is that a big city or a small city?

Hmm, though it has been choosen as the captical city of Shandong Province, i don't think that's a big city. As a matter of fact, in my prospect, it is a small city. As for the reason, I use to live near Quancheng Square, the center of this city. And later my parents moved to a department near Erhuan South Road, the south part of Jinan. Then, my high school is near Mount Hua, the north part of Jinan. At now, I live near the moutains in South East of Jinan, and there's a big train station on the North estern Jinan, it takes less than an hour's drive to get there. So in my opinion, that's quite a small city, for i have been to almost every part of Jinan and it won't take long to get through it.

###### 3. Is there anything you dislike about it?

For most people in my city, they would say the heavy traffic jam, and that's for sure a huge disadvantage living in such a crowded city. But I live uptown and have not suffered a lot. What bothers me the most was the the wether here. Spring is really short, maybe only a few days. And almost all of the days are windy. So does Autumn. Summer days are hot with heavy sun. And when it rains, it's usually rains cats and dogs, lasting for several days.  I enjoy playing in snow and make snowman in winter, but winter days are cold and dry, usually unfit for playing outside. And that would be all, everything else is quite find at present.

###### 4. What do you like (most) abot your hometown.

Well, I like those beautiful mountains in my hometown. Despite the well-known Qianfo Mountains, which is a famous cultural relitic, I like the mountains just lay behind my home the most. I am someone who works all day and looking for somewhere to get myself relaxed in the weekend, and these wild mountains are exactlly what I need. When I'm free on weekends, I would pack some food and go hiking in the mountains. The air is really freash, and the singing of the birds, the smell of nature, they really impressing and relaxing. So honestly those mountains behind my home are what I like the most in hometown.

###### 5. Do you like living there? / Do you like your hometown?

Not exactlly. I've been living here for so many years, I can feel the friendly citizens and the nice city. But the weather here isn't so nice to me. It's really hot in summmer days and so cold and dry during winner. I'm currently studying in Shanghai, and I'm feeling like the wet and cool weather in Shanghai. That's perfect for me, as my nose was allergic to dry air. So, maybe I should say I don't like living in my hometown quite much, but I still love here because it's where I grow up and where I live.

###### 6. How long have you been living there?

Emm, for almost 18 years? I've born in this city and have living there since then. We moved several times but still in the town. Before I enter the elementary school, my parents and I live in the city center. Then, in order to enter a good elementary school and senior high school, we moved to the south part of Jinan, where i can go to the best school here. And recently, I was a college student in ShangaiTech University, I spend most of my time in Shanghai, and my parents also moved to a house near the mountains. And that's all until now.

###### 7. Please describe your hometown a little.

Well, sure. My hometown, Jinan,is a beautiful city surrounded by mountains in three sides. In the north of Jinanthere's a huge lake called Daming Lake. When talke about jinan, I must mention the Springs there. By the way, Jinan has a nick name, called The Spring City, that's because it has so many Springs, like the most famous one, Baotu Spring. Despite that, there are plenty of Springs in every corner in the city, and it is said that in the old days, every family has its own spring in there garden. They used it to cook, to make the tea, and for daily use. I used to live in the city center and tasted lots of the springs. At present, I live in the south eastern part of Jinan, next to the mountains, I usually go hiking in the mountains on weekends or vacation, when you walk in the mountains, you'll feel relaxed, and the air is really fresh. What I can see are endless mountains, really fantasic.

###### 8. Do you think you will continue living there for a long time?

Well, no. At present, i'm studying in an University in Shanghai. And i only come back to here, my hometown, on vacations. If everything goes well, i would go for further study and may not continue to living in Jinan. Maybe in the future I will seek for a job in some of the major citys like Shanghai or Shenzhen. And then i will come there much less frequently.

### 2. Home/Accommodation

###### 1. Can you describe the place where you live?

Yes, I live in a house in the south-

### Part Two

#### 7. 积极改变.

> *Describe a positive change that you made in your life.*

##### Answer

I used to stay up late playing phone games or surfing online in the first year of my senior high school, sometimes in the morning, I had to get up in a hurry and ran to school, but still there were several times I was late for class. And I often felt asleep in afternoon classes. My grades went down gradually.

I found my deskmate always could keep concentrated on class. And he told me he usually was the first one to arrive the classroom, so he could have enough time to prepare for classes.

Then he told me jogging made him energetic all day. Jogging along the path in the park is also a good time for him to think about important things in life. I decided to jog with him.

You know, I used to get up late, so it was fairly challenging for me to get up early. After jogging three days, I wanted to give up. My friend told me that, if you made a goal, then you should try to make it, or you’d better don’t make the goal. He told me it’s terrible to be a person who often makes goals and gives them up.

I think the habit of jogging can help me to keep good health and ensure me with good energy for study, so I want to develop it.

##### Part 3

###### 4. What are the disadvantages when people keep making changes?

1) if xxx, have to adapt to new environment frequently, and everythime you'll have to spend time knowing things around you, that for sure one of the dis';
2) Also, keep make ing , maybe you will have a sense of unsteadiness,cause you don't stuck to a place for a long time and you move to another unfamilar env. That's might be fine for an energitic young man, but if chid or ,,..... they may feel upsed and unsecutity.
3) Last but not the least, always at the beginning, you started to do many thing but you may not done them, and thus you cannot get the sense of achievement, cause you haven't done any of them, though you've do a lot of things. That would be really disappointing.

##### Answer

last weekend, after dinner, I went out for a walk in my community as usual.

a child was riding a bicycle. He rode fast, when he turned around a corner, his bicycle was a little out of control, he fell down. I was walking there. I didn't find any adults with him, so I helped him up. But his bicycle chain was out of the track. I tried to help him to put the chain back, but we didn''t make it. Then I searched some helpful videos with my smart phone, with the assistance of the child and the help of videos, we fixed the bicycle finally.

Well, for the reason why I helped him. I guess I'm a kind person, to be honest, I just helped him without thinking anything.I felt it's just a common help. If I meet some difficulties, my neighbors will offer me helps as well.

#### 12. 交通拥堵(NEW)

##### Answer

I would tallk about a time when I need to go to the city center to take an English lesson in the early morning. That was the day when I was stuck in a heavy traffic jam. Knowing that reaching the city center would go through a very busy road, so I got up early and took a bus there. Unluckily, I mistaken the time it takes to reach there. When I was just about to arrive, maybe about one block to get to the bus stop, it was totally stucked.  Nothing has caused this traffic jam but too many cars on this road. What I could hear was the horns. I felt annoying so I put on my earphones and played some of my favorite music, which can make me feel relaxed. Sitting near the window, I looked at the cars, they didn't seem to move for any. And about half an hour later, It finally arrived and definately I was late for the class. It was an unpleasent trip, and I would set out earlier the next time.


##### Part3

###### 1. How can we solve the traffic jam problem?

1) to complete transportation system
2) to implement staggered shifting(单双号限行) on traffic system;
3) to encourage people to take public transportation;

###### 2. Do you think developing public transport can solve traffic jam problems?

Yes, I think so. Private cars occupy much more space on the road than public transportation to transport the same amount of people. And some private cars sometimes pull over casually, to some extent, that can increase traffic jam problems.

###### 3. Do you think the high ways will help reduce traffic jams?

I think so. That mainly because there are many traffic lights to stop cars, that will reduce traffic jams more or less. Drivers can't pull over casually on the high ways. What's more, there aren't pedestrians on the high ways, that can also lower down the amount of traffic jams.

###### 4. What are good ways to manage traffic?

1) to part the pavements from the drive lanes and bicycle lanes;
2) to set more traffic lights;
3) to make more traffic signs;
4) to improve public transportation system;
5) to encourage people to take public transportation more;


### Object and Activity

#### 1. 希望养成的习惯

Describe a habit your friend has and you want to develop.

##### Answer

China has a really long history of growing tea. Many people in my country have the habit of drinking tea. One of my friends has keeping the habit of drinking tea for nearly 10 years. She knows a lot about it, for example, she can name out nearly 20 kinds of different types of tea.

I first noticed her habit in my high school. The time of high school is the busiest time for students in China. We have to stay up late and get up early to cram for good results. I usually felt sleepy at that time, sometimes, I even could fall asleep in the class. I tried to drink coffee to keep me refreshed. But I guess coffee might be too strong for me, sometimes after drinking it, my hands would shake, my heart might beat fast or I would be too excited to sit there for a long time.

My friend suggested me to drink tea. I took her advice. The tea water tasted very mild. The smell of tea keeps me refreshed. After I had tried several times, I realized that tea was a perfect drink for me.  It's not strong; it keeps refreshed, but not very excited; I think it's suitable for Asian people; So I want to develop this habit.

(Actually, tea is more than a drink. I know it was ever the most important products on Silk Roads. It conveys Chinese history and civilization.)

  ...will learn from each other; but by comparison, bad habits are easy to form/shape;

with the influences of those children with bad habits, other children may no long obey regulations/manners/rules;

Describe a difficult desicion that you once made.

##### Answer

> When I was in the first year of high school, I met my first difficult decision in my school life, it was to choose to study arts or sciences;

> It will related to my future major in university and future job option;
>
> Before made the decision: compared the 9 subjects I was studying;

>
> I didn't have obvious preference on arts or science, so I used the ranking of arts and sciences to decide my subject.

---

People probably have changed their plans for various reasons. Recently, I changed my future study plan. To be honest, it was a big change for me.

In the three days, from 6^th^ to 9^th^ in June, I attended the university entrance exam. The result was not as good as I had expected, but still not bad. Then I applied my ideal university and I was enrolled.

In China, the university admission policies are different from most of other countries. Students who have passed the enrollment cut-off score/line still have few options to apply the majors that they are interested in.

Actually, I was enrolled by a major called International Trade which I totally knew nothing about. So I didn't think I could have motivation to go further study in that filed.  After discussing with my parents, I decided to study abroad.

I felt changing my study plan was a good decision. Coz I wanted to follow my heart. And also, I felt so grateful for my parents' support. You know, the oversea university tuition fee is a burden for a family. So I'll try my hard to start an independent life. Well, homesickness is another thing I should concern.


##### Part 3

###### 1.What decisions do people usually make in their daily lives?

daily routines;

to get up early or late; to dress what; to eat what; on what time to go out;

###### 2. Which is easier, making a decision by yourself or making a decision after group discussion?

That should depend on how big the responsibility I should take after making the decision. For example, the decision about a project or a work, ...

Private stuff: like to make decision by myself; make me to be confident;

I prefer to make a decision by myself. Because, having a group discussion with others, they may come up with different ideas; it will be hard for me to choose;

I like to to make a decision after a group discussion. Because I can't consider overall; not confident enough to make a decision; not decisive;

###### 3. Why are many young people unwilling to follow their parents' advice?

1) They are grown-up; they are mature and capable enough to make decisions by themselves; have their own ideas
2) parents control them too much
3) generation gap: parents may old-fashioned; can't catch up with the trend;
4) young people are eager to have chance to make decision;

###### 4. Why would middle-aged people tend to second-guess(预测) their own decisions?

middle-aged: have to take the responsibility of nurturing their young children and take care of old generation as well; so they have much pressure and burden from life; make them cautious to make decisions; sometimes, they may can't take the bad consequence; so... second-guess....

not decisive;

have experienced many things: can foresee something;


#### 3. 自行车/摩托车/汽车旅行

Describe a bicycle/motorcycle/car trip you ***would like*** to go.

##### Answer

 I like travelling. Being to different places bring me back a lot of good memories. And I think my horizon is also widened.

And recently, I have been planning to have a car trip to Inner Mongolia. If my parents can have their annual leaves for a week, I'd like to go with them. You know, travelling with parents would be good family time; and being out with them, I can save much money on travelling.

I've browsed some travel websites. They all said that the best time to go to Inner Mongolia is at the end of its summer. At late July or early August, the grass is tall and green, the sky is blue with good sunshine, the weather is moderate, and so it's the best time to ride a horse to experience the beautiful natural scenes of the  **prairie** .

Inner Mongolia has very low population density. The public transportation is not very good in some (rural) places, but those places have the best natural sites, so it's better to go there by private car. That's one of the reasons why I'd like have a car trip there. Besides, I plan to have some camping there; so we need to take more belongings like camping tents, picnic tables and so on. That's the other reason why...

Carnivore; carnival; drive license;



#### 4. 想学的一项有趣的技能

Descrbe a skill you are interested in and want to learn more about.

##### Answer1

There is a skill that I want to learn more, it's ice skating;

When I was young in primary school, my friend took me to an ice-skating center at a weekend; he was good at it; I could roller skate, so I thought ice-skating wasn't difficult for me; but the ice was much more **slippery** than the ground; I fell down several times. The last time when I fell down, I broke my nose heavily. When I stood up, my nose couldn't stop  **bleeding(流血)** .  Then I was sent to a hospital and had an operation on my nose. After that, my parents didn't allow me to skate again.

I want to continue learn it, coz I think skating is interesting. I can't run fast, so I very enjoy the **speed** that the skating brings to me.

I plan to ask 2 or 3 friends who are good at skating to help me to learn. You know, last time, when I first did ice-skating, I hurt my nose. I think one friend maybe not enough to help me.And I'll go to a skating center with my friends to learn it. That's how I would like to learn.

##### Answer2

I want to develop a kind of defensive skill -- called Aikido. I first knew about it when I was about 10 years old in my primary school. My father thought I needed to learn a kind of sporty skill to develop my braveness. One day, he took me to an aikido studio. I saw several people were there in a circle. The coach was in the middle. When the people attacked the coach, he used some skillful techniques pulling down all of them in a minute. My father told me that the coach needn't use much strength, he only borrowed the power from the attackers. To be honest, the skill was really cool. But I had some difficulties to communicate with strangers or new people at that time, I even refused to stay with my classmates after class. Sometimes, when guests came to my home, I would stay in my room until they left. I had one aikido class, the time in that new environment with strangers made me really uncomfortable. Although I was interested in aikido, I still refused to learn it continuously.

Now, I'm outgoing, and I think it's necessary for girls to learn some defensive skills to protect ourselves. And aikido doesn't require much on strength, it's suitable for girls. If I have this skill, it will be....


> Tai Chi / Shadow Boxing
>
> Tai Chi is an ancient Chinese internal martial art system, which combines profound principles, theories and martial art techniques. The slow, soft and continuously flowing movements appear mysterious on the surface. However, it is the cultivation of one's internal energy, mind and the physical body that make it so unique and challenging. To generate relaxation, Tai Chi practice requires a deep level of concentration and a focused mind, thus allowing the mind to lead and guide the body's energy.
>
> Tai Chi is not only a martial art, but has also been widely acknowledged as being an effective health exercise. Whether Tai Chi is practiced for health, as athletic sport or martial art it takes time, patience and qualitative practice to develop Tai Chi's internal properties. To achieve a high standard in Tai Chi training is a highly complex process.
